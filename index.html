      <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Risper and I am a web designer. I am currently skilled in HTML and CSS. I enjoy making awesome web pages that are customized to suit your needs. Take a look at some of the sites I have made <a href="projects.html">here</a> and let me help you own a stunning website to showcase your work.</p>

        <p>Spending time in the health industry was an eye-opening experience into life.One does not appreciate the gift of life until faced with the realization of how fickle it is. So after reflection I realized that much as I was helping society I was deeply unfulfilled. I lacked a creative outlet since most of the work I did was mostly routine.I discovered the limitless fun there is to coding and decided to make a permanent switch. It's been endless fun since.</p>
